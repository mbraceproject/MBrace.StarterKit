In going from two to three dimensions, ''Super Mario 64'' placed an emphasis on exploration within vast worlds that require the player to complete multiple diverse missions, replacing the linear obstacle courses of traditional platform games.

==Gameplay==
[[File:N64 Super Mario 64 whomp fortress.jpg|thumb|left|Levels like Whomp's Fortress require the player to navigate chasms.]]
''Super Mario 64'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[platform game|platformer]] where the player controls [[Mario]] through several courses. Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink "peace-loving" Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a [[boss (video games)|boss]], solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible.<ref name="NP88">{{Cite journal| date= September 1996| title= Full Coverage&nbsp;— Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 88| pages= 14–23}}</ref><ref name="playersguide"/> The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses.<ref name="playersguide"/> There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely.

Some courses have special cap power-ups which augment Mario's abilities. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.<ref name="playersguide"/> Some courses contain [[cannon]]s that Mario can access by speaking to a pink [[List of Mario series enemies#Bob-omb|Bob-omb Buddy]]. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.

===Controls===
Mario's abilities in ''Super Mario 64'' are far more diverse than those of previous ''Mario'' games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, or punch using the [[game controller]]'s [[analog stick]] and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and three times in a row, respectively), long jump and [[Somersault|backflip]]. There are also special maneuvers, such as [[wall jump]]ing; jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high.<ref name="playersguide"/><ref name="instructions"/> The player can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.<ref name="NP88"/><ref name="playersguide"/>

==Plot and setting==
''Super Mario 64'' is set in [[Princess Peach's Castle]], which consists of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory area in which the player can experiment, testing his or her player skills. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses via secret walls and paintings.<ref name="NP88"/> ''Super Mario 64'' begins with a letter from [[Princess Peach]] inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him.<ref>'''Princess Peach's note''': "Dear Mario: Please come to the castle. I've baked a cake for you. Yours truly-- Princess Toadstool, ''Peach''." {{cite video game| title = Super Mario 64| developer = [[Nintendo EAD]]| publisher = Nintendo | date= 1996-09-29| platform= Nintendo 64}}</ref> However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that [[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]] has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the [[stained-glass window]] above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him and baking the cake that she had promised him.<ref name="playersguide">{{cite book|year=1996|title=Official Super Mario 64 Player's Guide|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref><ref name="instructions">{{cite book| year=1996|title=Super Mario 64 Instruction Booklet| publisher=Nintendo| id=NUS-NSME-USA}}</ref><ref>'''Princess Peach''': "Mario!

==Development==
[[File:Super Mario 64 jumping.jpg|thumb|Mario can perform a wide range of jumps, among other moves.]]
The development of ''Super Mario 64'' took less than two years, but it was reported that producer and director [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] had conceived of a 3D ''Mario'' game concept over five years before, while working on ''[[Star Fox (SNES)|Star Fox]]''.<ref name="interview">{{Cite journal| date= January 1996| title= The Game Guys - (Spaceworld 1995)| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]|issue= 80| url= http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=interviews&id=1996-01-np080-miya-tezu&m=html}}</ref> Miyamoto developed most of the concepts during the era of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) and considered using the [[Super FX]] chip to make it a SNES game, but decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 due to the former system's technical limitations.<ref name="IGN100-2007"/><ref name=nsider>{{cite web| url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=223| title=Profile: Shigeru Miyamoto Chronicles of a Visionary| publisher=N-Sider| author=Grajqevci, Jeton| date=2000-10-09| accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref> [[IGN]] said that Miyamoto had conceived of his idea as a proposed game called ''Super Mario FX''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.cheats.ign.com/objects/142/14217644.html |title=IGN: Super Mario FX |publisher=Uk.cheats.ign.com |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}</ref> On his [[Twitter]] [[Dylan Cuthbert]] stated that there was never a ''Super Mario FX'' game ever in development, and that "Super Mario FX" was the internal code name of the FX chip.<ref>"[http://twitter.com/#!/dylancuthbert/statuses/165596909413728256 165596909413728256]." [[Twitter]]. Retrieved on February 19, 2012. "SNES Central @dylancuthbert I'm researching unreleased SNES games, was a game called "Super Mario FX" ever in development? Dylan Cuthbert @snescentral no, that was the internal code name for the FX chip"</ref>

The game's development began with the creation of the characters and [[Virtual camera system|camera system]]. Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take; months were spent selecting a camera view and layout that would be appropriate.<ref name="goddard interview">{{Cite journal| date= December 2001| title= The Making of Mario 64: Giles Goddard Interview| journal= [[NGC Magazine]]| publisher= [[Future Publishing]]|issue= 61}}</ref> The original concept involved the game having fixed path much like an [[isometric projection|isometric]] type game (similar to ''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]''), before the choice was made to settle on a free-roaming 3D design.<ref name="goddard interview"/> Although the majority of ''Super Mario 64'' would end up featuring the free-roaming design, elements of the original fixed path concept would remain in certain parts of the game, particularly in the three Bowser encounters. One of the programmers of ''Super Mario 64'', Giles Goddard, explained that these few linear elements survived as a means to force players into Bowser's lair rather than to encourage exploration.<ref name="goddard interview"/> The development team placed high priority on getting Mario's movements right, and before levels were created, the team was testing and refining Mario's animations on a simple grid. The first test scenario used to try out controls and physics involved Mario and a golden rabbit named "MIPS" by the developers (named for the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS-type]] CPU used by the Nintendo 64), the latter of which was included in the final release of the game as a means to obtain two of the Power Stars. The developers initially tried to make the game split screen co-op using both Mario and Luigi. Initially, the two characters would start at separate points in the castle and work their way through the game together. However, developers were unable to make the gameplay work.<ref name="destructoid-mario">{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/mario-64-once-had-a-co-op-mode-156090.phtml |title=Mario 64 once had a co-op mode |publisher=Destructoid |date= |accessdate=2011-08-30}}</ref>

Shigeru Miyamoto's guiding design philosophy behind ''Super Mario 64'' was to "include more details" than found in games prior to the Nintendo 64.<ref name="interview"/> Some details were inspired by real life. For example, the [[Boo (Nintendo)|Boos]] are based on assistant director [[Takashi Tezuka]]'s wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, "is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work. In the game, there is now a character which shrinks when Mario looks at it, but when Mario turns away, it will grow large and menacing."<ref name="NP-75">{{Cite journal| date= August 1995| title= Miyamoto Interview| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]|issue= 75| url= http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0895.shtml}}</ref> ''Super Mario 64'' is also characterized by featuring more puzzles than earlier ''Mario'' games. It was developed simultaneously with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', but as ''Ocarina of Time'' was released more than two years later, some puzzles were taken from that game for ''Super Mario 64''.<ref name="interview2">{{Cite journal| date= October 1996| title= Miyamoto Interview| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 89| url= http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/1096.shtml}}</ref>

Information about ''Super Mario 64'' first leaked out in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the world premiere for the Nintendo 64 (then known as the "Ultra 64") at [[Nintendo Space World]]. The basic controls had at this point been implemented, and the game was reportedly 50% finished, although most of the course design remained. Thirty-two courses were created for the game. Miyamoto thought he would create more, up to 40 courses, not including bonus levels. The actual number turned out much lower in the final game, though, as only 15 courses could fit.<ref name="interview"/><ref name="NP-75"/>

===Audio===
The music was composed by veteran composer [[Koji Kondo]], who used new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier games as well as entirely new material. ''Super Mario 64'' was one of the first games in the series to feature [[Charles Martinet]] as the voice of Mario. It also features the voices of Leslie Swan (then Senior Editor of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'') as Princess Peach, who also wrote the English text for the game,<ref name="NP89-2">{{Cite journal| date= October 1996| title = Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 89| page= 67}}</ref> and Isaac Marshall as Bowser. The characters speak more in the English version than in the Japanese version.<ref name="interview2"/> In addition, dialogue and some sounds differ between the Japanese and English versions. Some of these vocal changes for the English release were brought to the Japanese [[Rumble Pak]] edition. When ''Super Mario 64 DS'' was released, all the voices were kept consistent in both the English and Japanese versions.

[[Video game journalism|Video game publications]] and [[Video game developer|developers]] praised ''Super Mario 64'' for its design and use of the 3D gameplay. The game is counted by [[1UP.com]] as one of the first games to have brought a series of 2D games into full 3D.<ref name="1up1"/> In the transition to 3D, many of the series conventions were rethought drastically, placing an emphasis on exploration over traditional platform jumping, or "hop and bop" action. While its quality was disputed by some, it has been argued that it established an entirely new genre, different from that of previous games in the series.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3211627.stm | title=Platform video games evolve | publisher=BBC News | date=2003-10-25 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> ''Official Nintendo Magazine'' referred to the game as a "masterpiece of game design" and stated that Nintendo was able to take its "number-one 2D franchise and convert it flawlessly into 3D".<ref name="ONM-5">{{Cite journal| date= July 2006| title= What do you mean, you've never played... Super Mario 64| journal= [[Official Nintendo Magazine]]| publisher= [[Future Publishing]]|issue= 5| page= 17}}</ref> Michael Grayford of [[Liquid Entertainment]] stated he was initially "very turned off" by the openness of the game the first time he played it. Upon playing it later, he was "highly pleased" and stated "each level brought some new unique cool gameplay element and I was never bored".<ref name="GameSpy50">{{cite web | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july01/top502ase/index3.shtm| title=GameSpy's Top 50 Games of All Time | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | month=July | year=2001 | accessdate=2006-02-11| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060208082455/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july01/top502ase/index3.shtm| archivedate = February 8, 2006}}</ref> [[Warren Spector]], former lead designer at [[Ion Storm Inc.]], stated it was "not possible to squeeze this much gameplay into a single game" and "no game has done a better job of showing goals before they can be attained, allowing players to make a plan and execute on it". He also praised the exploration aspect of the game, commenting that "[allowing players to] explore the same spaces several times while revealing something new each time is a revelation".<ref name="GameSpy50" />

==Impact and legacy==

Critics attribute the initial success of the Nintendo 64 console to ''Super Mario 64''. ''Edge'' magazine referred to it as the Nintendo 64's "key launch title".<ref name="Edge177">{{Cite journal| date= July 2007| title= Who Dares Wins| journal= [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]| publisher= [[Future Publishing]]|issue= 177|pages= 62–71}}</ref> ''Game Informer'' commented that the game helped the launch of the Nintendo 64.<ref name="GI171"/> ''Official Nintendo Magazine'' and GameDaily also attributed some of the initial excitement of the Nintendo 64 system to the release of ''Super Mario 64''.<ref name="ONM-5"/><ref name="GD-Top25">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-greatest-nintendo-games/225/?page=19| title = Top 25 Greatest Nintendo Games - #7 Super Mario 64 (N64)| publisher = GameDaily| accessdate = 2008-02-09}}</ref> Though the system was initially very successful, it eventually lost much of its market share to Sony's [[PlayStation]]. 1UP.com attributed this decline to Nintendo's use of cartridges and the design of the [[Nintendo 64 controller]], which were reportedly implemented by Shigeru Miyamoto for ''Super Mario 64''.<ref name="1up1"/> The game also set many precedents for 3D platformers to follow.<ref name="1up1"/><ref name="GWR08-2">{{cite book|editor= Craig Glenday| title= Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008| series= [[Guinness World Records]]| date= 2008-03-11| publisher= Guinness|isbn= 978-1-904994-21-3| pages= 108–110| chapter= Record Breaking Games: Platform Games}}</ref> GameDaily listed the game as one of the "Most Influential Video Games" and stated it "defined the 3-D platform experience, influencing numerous designers to create their own, original offerings".<ref>{{cite web| title = Most Influential Video Games| url = http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/most-influential-video-games/168/?page=12| publisher = GameDaily| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090618001625/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/most-influential-video-games/168/?page=12| archivedate = 18 June 2009| deadurl = yes| accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref> ''[[GamesTM]]'' noted many game companies, including Nintendo, have tried to develop a platform game to match up to ''Super Mario 64''.<ref name="gamesTM-63">{{cite journal| last= gamesTM Staff| first=| publication-date= November 2007| title=Super Mario Galaxy Review| journal=[[gamesTM]]| publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]| issue=63| page=129}}</ref> ''Super Mario 64'' was notable for its sense of freedom and [[linearity (computer and video games)|non-linearity]]. A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game's mission-based level design was an inspiration for other game designers. For example, [[Martin Hollis]], who produced and directed ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', says "the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from ''Super Mario 64''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoonami.com/briefing/2004-09-02.php | title=The Making of GoldenEye 007 | publisher=[[Zoonami]]| date=2004-09-02 | accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref>

''Super Mario 64'' was the first game to have a "free" camera that could be controlled independently of the character.<ref name="GWR08-2"/> Most 3D games at the time used a [[first-person shooter|first-person]] perspective, or a camera that was fixed in position relative to the player's character, or to the level. To create freedom of exploration, and more fluid control in a 3D world, the designers created a dynamic system in which the [[professional video camera|video camera]] was operated by the in-game character [[List of Mario series enemies#Lakitu|Lakitu]].<ref name="instructions"/> ''Nintendo Power'' stated the camera-control scheme was what transitioned platform games into the 3D era.<ref name="WiiHandbook08">{{cite journal| title = Everything Old-School is New Again| issue = Winter Special 2008| journal = [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher = [[Future Publishing]]| date = Winter 2008| page = 42}}</ref> They would again cite ''Super Mario 64'', along with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', as two games that "blazed trails" into the 3D era.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Nintendo Power]] 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]] |page= 48 }}</ref> ''Edge'' stated the game changed "gamers' expectations of 3D movement forever".<ref name="Edge177"/> The camera system would become the standard for 3D platform games in the future.<ref name="NP88"/> The Nintendo 64's analog stick allowed for more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital [[D-pad]]s of other consoles, and ''Super Mario 64'' used this in a way that was unique for its time. At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character's perspective. ''Super Mario 64''{{'}}s controls were fully analog, and interpreted a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick also allowed for precise control over subtleties such as the speed at which Mario runs. ''Super Mario 64'' was of the first games to implement the system.<ref>{{Cite journal| date= June 1996| title= N64 Exclusive| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]] |issue= 85| pages= 16–17}}</ref>

Because of the game's popularity, rumors about glitches and secrets spread rapidly after its release. The most common rumor was that [[Luigi]] was a secret character in the game, fueled by illegible symbols in the castle courtyard that resembled the text "L is real 2401". This same texture would reappear in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' on a plaque in Dodongo's Cavern. IGN received so many questions and supposed methods to unlock Luigi that the staff offered a [[United States dollar|US$]]100 bounty to anyone who could prove that Luigi was in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060383p1.html | title = In Search of Luigi| publisher=IGN| author = IGN Staff| date = 1996-11-13| accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref> The number of false codes submitted to IGN dropped dramatically, as Luigi's inclusion was proved to be a myth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060392p1.html| title=Luigi Still Missing| publisher=IGN| author = IGN Staff| date = 1996-11-20| accessdate = 2007-10-11}}</ref> The [[April Fools' Day]] 1998 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' claimed that the cryptic phrase would be discussed on the non-existent page 128, and also featured a facetious article titled "Luigi 64", commenting humorously on the rumor.<ref name="npapr98">{{Cite journal| date= April 1998| title= April News Briefs| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 107| pages= 80–81}}</ref>

On May 5, 2011, ''Super Mario 64'' was selected as one of the 80 games that will be displayed at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] as part of "[[The Art of Video Games]]" exhibit that will open on March 16, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/#!5799017/the-smithsonian-has-picked-the-games-of-its-art-of-video-games-exhibit|title=The Smithsonian Has Picked the Games of Its Art of Video Games Exhibit|publisher=Kotaku|date=2011-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/|title=The Art of Video Games|publisher=[[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]}}</ref>

Instead, ''Super Mario 64'' was followed by other sequels on subsequent Nintendo systems.
