The Global Hockey League was a proposed hockey league that was supposed to begin in November of 1990.

The following cities were awarded teams; Birmingham, Los Angeles (CA), Miami (FL), Cleveland (OH), Albany (NY) and Providence (RI) as teams in North America. Canada would have had two entries, Saskatoon (Saskatchewan) and Hamilton (Ontario). Plans called for teams overseas to be located in London (England), Lyons (France), Milan (Italy), Rotterdam (Netherlands), Prague (Czechoslovakia) and Berlin (Germany). Two more franchises were to be added in Europe and four more in North America at a later date. The GHL is was in negotiations to place the first professional sports team in Russia with a franchise in Moscow.


The league was to try to make their games more attractive to television by having two thirty minute periods instead of three twenty minute periods. Other proposed rule changes were to eliminate the center red line and have a shootout in case of a tie at the end of regular play. The removal of the red line should open up the rink for longer and more daring passes. The GHL also hoped to eliminate the violence and fighting found in most hockey games by awarding penalty shots for high sticking infractions.

Each team was to have a $2.3 million salary cap.

This article refers to "''Griddy''" in it's colloquialist form as originating in the state of [[Western Australia]], [[Australia]].

Generally speaking a ‘''Griddy''’ is a person who applies his or hers intellectual ability on mindless, pointless or non-financially beneficial activities. The act in which a ''Griddy'' partakes is commonly known as ''Griddling''. ''Griddies'' usually operate during company hours or at the expense of others, however have been known to use their personal/recreational time; as ''Griddling'' to a ''Griddy'' is frequently seen as a form of enjoyment. 

An example of ''Griddling'' is creating blogs/definitions, on internet sites such as this, that share very little or nil relevance to general society.

Am writing on behalf of most soliders in the rlc at deepcut, people have been hearing about the deaths at deepcut, which was an upseting moment for us, now people think deepcut is a bad place and worry about the "little soliders" going there. 

Well believe me, i passed out in a phase one camp called "pirbright" which is a good place,
i always was looking forward to been in the army, until i went to "Deepcut" no am sorry i joined. from my and some others in deepcut with me, i think deepcut should be closed down for good. so what ever you rcts want to do dont be in the Royal logistic corp, for your on sake.

thank you

Name: Ashley Chapman 
Status: MYP first Prime Minister of UKYP
Constituency: Hartlepool 
Born: 5th December 1991

--------------------------------------------------------

Which political issues are you most passionate about?

As opposed to being passionate about one issue in today’s society, I am passionate about many. I feel that the ‘ASBOs’ are given for pathetic reasons, for example, you can get an ASBO for standing on a street corner. If inadequate facilities are provided for the children then does it not mean that kids will get ASBOs for nothing? Bullying is an issue that is ‘neglected’ and not taken seriously in most councils.

What do you feel is the biggest issue for young people in your constituency?

I think that the biggest issue in my area is that there are not enough places for young people to go.

What do you hope to achieve during your term of office?

I hope that in my term of service I can provide more joy to the children of Hartlepool by making more places for them to go (football pitches, youth clubs, skate parks etc), lowering bullying and sorting out a few ‘dodgy’ laws with regards to the ASBOs.

What is your future career ambition?

I plan on becoming a psychiatrist, a virologist or even moving into politics. 

Which public figure do you most admire and why?

I have a lot of respect for Albert Einstein, as he was a perfect example of what we should aspire to. He defined several key things that can and will have an affect in shaping the future world. It would be my dream that, someday, I would be remembered in record books for creating or defining something that’s as fascinating as the things he has done.

If there was one message you could send to the government, what would it be?

That they need to wake up and realise that we live in an ever evolving world. They think that a child wearing a hoody is more criminal than a man committing murder, or burgling a house.

Additional comments:

I would like to thank everybody that voted me in and promise I will strive to create a better, brighter and more colourful future for all of Hartlepool’s children.

Note: Please create a article from this. It would be good to get youth parliament more renowned.

=== Ground ===
O Shea Park, Riverview, Tower, Blarney.

Blarney United was founded in 1949, a very difficult undertaking at the time as there was really no such thing as a rural soccer club. They entered the Athletic Union League (an organisation that was then in its infancy). Blarney had the use of a playing pitch in Tower, the pitch had been used by Shournagh Valley hurling team until it was disbanded. Although they never won any competition, the Club enjoyed good times in the mid 1950’s. However, towards the end of the decade they lost the use of their pitch and the Club disbanded shortly afterwards.

Following England’s victory in the 1966 World Cup and the arrival of TV, there was a major increase in the interest in soccer and a group of interested people decided to reform the club. Blarney United was reformed in 1967, and won its section of the AUL third division in its first year. The following year  the now famous Square League was started and has since been one of the highlights of summer soccer in Cork (thanks to the continued support of Blarney Castle Estate).

Since then the Club has prospered, winning all of the major competitions on offer at Junior level in the Cork area. Our Schoolboy section is alive and well and is also sharing in the Club's success. This improvement has come about due to the success of our excellently run Academy which was set up some years ago. Currently we cater for boys from the tender age of six. 

In 2004 the Club decided to go Senior and in its first season won the Munster Senior League First Division title along with The Pop Kelleher Cup and The Over 35 Floodlight Cup. In our first season in the Munster Senior League Premier Division we finished a very creditable fourth, and reached the final of the F.A.I. Intermediate Cup.

Down through the years Blarney United always had a problem in securing a permanent home. As already stated they played in Tower in the 1950’s. On reforming in 1967 their first pitch was the Blarney Castle Sports Field, from there they moved to Paul’s Cross where the Club enjoyed moderate success and  built up an underage section. Having lost the use of this pitch the Club moved to Newcastle a few miles out. After a few years of mixed results it returned to Blarney and played  in what is now Gleann Na Ri and Joe O Reilly’s before moving to Riverview. While O’Shea park was being developed the club moved to Monard, but due to lack of facilities locally the first team was forced to play its home matches in Carrigaline for a season. It was a great day for all concerned that  when the Club returned to the refurbished O’ Shea  Park in 2001 it was as  proud holders of the AUL Premier Division and the AOH Cup.

It is hoped to further develop our facilities and introduce worthwhile modern developments that will be of benefit to the youth of both Blarney and Tower.<br /><br />

After its Abitur in Celle (1954) Beyme made first 1954-1956 training as the publisher and bookseller. Subsequently, it studied 1956-1961 at the Universities of Heidelberg, Bonn, Munich, Paris and Moscow political science, history, history of art and sociology. The unusual selection of the study place Moscow (1959-60) resulted from interest and life history of Beyme. In the people's highschool K learned. from Beyme Russian and successfully applied for (student) the exchange. [Source: Interview of 05.07.1999]

1961-1962 were Beyme “Research Fellow” at the “Russian Research center” the Harvard University, the graduation 1963 in Heidelberg followed after a Assistenztätigkeit the Habilitation ebd. 1967. Subsequently, Beyme tidy professor at the Eberhard Karl university Tübingen (1967-1973) was also brief, 1971 rector of this university. it received a call to 1972 to the Johann Wolfgang Goethe university in Frankfurt/Main. 1972-1973 he was a chairman of the German combination for political science.

Finally Beyme 1974-1999 was a tidy professor at the University of Heidelberg and led Institut for political science. 1982-1985 he was a president “internationally of the Political Science Association”, 1983-1990 member of the Research Council at European Hochschulinstitut, Florenz, 1985 guest professor to the “École of the Sciences of politiques” in Paris, 1979 guest professor to the Stanford University (California), 1987 FF.

Beyme received often appreciating acknowledgment for its scientific activity, among other things to 1995 the honorary membership of the Humboldt university in Berlin, 1998 the university medal of the University of Heidelberg and 2001 the University of Berne, the moreover one is it member of the Berlin Brandenburgi Academy of Sciences

A study from the year 1998 had to the result that Professor Klaus von Beyme with rank of 10 “only Germans under the Top Ten of the world-wide most important politics policies” is. Beymes unusual meaning for the subject shows up also on level of the German Federal Republic. 41 per cent of the scientists designated Beyme as a most important representative of the political science in Germany, asked in the study. On place two it is with the question about the most important Fachvertretern regarding its “professionspolitischen meaning”. Again most the asked one believed that Klaus von Beyme enjoys the best Reputation of all politics scientists in the public. Twice Beyme was to be found also among the most important representatives of individual research fields. Both with the topic area “he ranks political theory, political philosophy and idea history” and with the field of activity “comparative political science/system comparison” at the second place. (Blade man/Falter 1998)

Beymes main point of research is the comparative investigation of the systems of government in particular in Europe, in the former “Eastern Bloc”. To its most important fields of activity like “comparative political science”, “political theory” as well as “Policy analysis” (cultural policy, art and politics, housing and town-planning policy) Beyme has to register numerous publications. Beyme sees the United States as model (see being discussion with the weekly paper “the time”, expenditure from 12 December 1998).

In his spare time Klaus von Beyme is concerned with painting and history of art. From this its work results “the age of the avant-garde. Art and society 1905-1955”.

Like Fm is ‘revolution Like no other’, where four employed DJs attend private parties, and together work in cohesion to produce a new creation sound never heard before. The DJs practice at their secondary music where they play music during the students' break-time.

===Like Quotations===
This section of the company influenced the expressions used in Malta as they created many new popular phrases. Examples of these expressions are; ''A revolution'' '''Like''' ''no other'', '''Like''' ''anything, but better'', ''bonjour'' and ''Nanna Ivy''(in Maltese Nanna is a grandmother)

===Like Nannas===
As previously mention a ''Nanna'' is a ''grandmother'' in Maltese. This little section of the company is dedicated to those little nannas we all love. We’d like to take the opportunity to thank them for all those christmas cakes and mince pies. '''Ms. Nanna Ivy''' is the Like industries Inc official grandmother.

Saturday Night fever is no laughing matter, it kills millions of people each day.
it can only get by dancing your ass off and dricking at the sametime. it only atacks
the liver and brain at the sametime. the fever kicks in after a few days. all the person
can think about is dancing on saturdays and dricking. if the person goes dancing on a weekday
the person dies in seconds. you can tell if they have the fever by these:
waving of the finger,
dancing randomly,
drinking in the morning,
singing,
playing load music,
and always thinging about going out.
heres waht you can do to stop this from happing to you. make sure you dont dance all night.
that is the number one thing you can do. if you do dance all night. make sure you get lots of rest,
stay home and dont go no where. do not drink beer or anything like that. smoking, well you shouldn't be smoking anyway.

Fort Vinton, aka "Post #2", was a small Florida military outpost that existed from 1839 to 1850, located roughtly 16 miles west of present-day Vero Beach and 20 miles northeast of Fort Drum [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Drum%2C_Florida] Archeologists posit the 
forts exact location to be just south of the intersection of Florida state 
road 60 and 122nd avenue. 

The fort existed mostly to help quell the periodic  problems with the Seminole 
amerindians and was abandoned for good in 1850 after the final battle with that 
tribe. For most of its existence it was simply known as "Post #2" but was renamed in honor of Major John Rogers Vinton (1801-1847) just before it was closed.

In the 1800s, the forts location would have been on the edge of a steaming mosquito-infested cypress swamp, days away from any trace of civilization ;
undoubtably one of the least-desireable postings any soldier could imagine. Today the area is planted in oranges and grapefruit, though it's still steaming and mosquito-infested.

Dan Kovach is a person who lives in Cleveland Ohio. He lives with his mortal enemy, Greg Green Petroski, who claims that he was a polar bear in the past life. The only other known fact about Dan Kovach is that he is god. If he wants to vandalize fountains at malls by putting dozens of fish in them, he does. If he wants to completly plagerize a religion report, he does, and he doesent care if he gets 50 poins and detention because he is god. He can even ride a red wagon off of a 5 foot wall and survive with no injuries. The most impressive fact about Dan Kovach is that he is also god of all prank calls.

Tenth song on Faith No More's fourth studio album "Angel Dust". Deals with the fact that lead singer Mike Patton's dad was a coach when he was young, and the idea of not losing in sports. This left an impression on Patton, and the song is sort of a release from this belief as "You can't win them all".
