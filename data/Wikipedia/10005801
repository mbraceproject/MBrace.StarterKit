'''Waller Hall''' is the oldest building on the campus of [[Willamette University]] in [[Salem, Oregon]], [[United States]]. Built in 1867 as University Hall, the five-story, red-brick structure was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.<ref>{{cite web | title = Oregon National Register List | publisher = Oregon Parks & Recreation Dept.: Heritage Programs: National Register | url= http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/HCD/NATREG/docs/oregon_nr_list.pdf | accessdate = 2007-08-31 | format = [[PDF]] }}</ref> The building has been gutted twice by fires with the interior rebuilt each time, and went through renovations in 1987 to 1989 and again in 2005.

Built in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style of architecture, it is currently used for administration offices and is the oldest university building west of the Mississippi in the U.S. still in use. Waller Hall is located on the north end of campus opposite the [[Oregon State Capitol]] building across State Street. Designed in the shape of a Greek cross, each side has the same measurements and the top has a cupola.

==History==
===Background===
Due to a variety of factors, including the deterioration of the main campus building dating from 1844 and the need for additional space, the university considered building a new building designed specifically for the university beginning in the 1850s.<ref name=Hines>Hines, Gustavus. ''Oregon and Its Institutions; Comprising a Full History of the Willamette University''. Carlton & Porter, 1868.</ref> Then on October 3, 1860, the board of trustees for the school resolved to begin the process of building a new primary hall to be used by the [[university]].<ref name=Hines/> Reverend [[Alvin F. Waller]] was placed in charge of the efforts to raise the funds needed for a building.<ref name=Hines/> However, this was unsuccessful and on November 19, 1862, the board again passed a resolution calling for a new structure and forming a committee of Waller, [[Gustavus Hines]], [[Josiah Lamberson Parrish]], J. Lamson, and [[John H. Moores]] to prepare plans.<ref name=Hines/>

On December 2, the trustees authorized [[subscriptions]] to be solicited and paid to Waller with a goal of $20,000.<ref name=Hines/> On May 20, 1863, the board met again and learned that $12,800 had been pledged and the board then set up a building committee of Waller, Hines, Moores, E.N. Cook, and [[Thomas Milton Gatch]].<ref name=Hines/> It was mainly through the efforts of the Reverend Waller that the hall was built.<ref name=SOH>{{cite web| last = Gibby| first = Susan| title = Willamette University| publisher = Salem Online History| url = http://www.salemhistory.net/education/willamette_university.htm| accessdate =  2007-03-12}}</ref> Several designs were then considered for the new building, and on February 22, 1864, by a vote of 16 to 1 the board selected the final plan that called for a brick building with a stone foundation.<ref name=Hines/> The foundation was to rise to a level {{convert|3|ft|m}} above the ground to prevent moisture from the ground seeping into the bricks.<ref name=Hines/>

===Construction===
Construction of the new building began in February 1864 with excavation of the basement.<ref name=Hines/> This was on the north section of Willamette’s campus in downtown Salem.<ref name=eesi>{{cite web| url = http://www.eesinet.com/WillametteUniv.pdf | title = EESI: Waller Hall Renovation: Mechanical Design | accessdate = 2007-08-31}}</ref> Then on July 24, the cornerstone of the building was laid into place in a ceremony.<ref name=Hines/> The President of the Board of Trustees, [[David Leslie (Oregon politician)|David Leslie]], laid the cornerstone of the hall.<ref name=salem>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070927230124/http://www.open.org/~pioneerc/pg26.html David Leslie.] Salem Pioneer Cemetery. Retrieved on July 19, 2009.</ref> This ceremony included a time capsule and a speech by [[Governor of Oregon|Governor]] [[A. C. Gibbs]].<ref name=Hines/>

All of the [[brick]]s used in the construction were fired on campus using clay excavated from the construction site in order to build the foundation.<ref name=SOH/> The builders ordered 500,000 bricks total for the construction project.<ref name=Walton>{{cite journal

The old school building, the [[Oregon Institute]], burned down in December 1872 leaving University Hall as the only building on campus.<ref name=first>Cowger, Wright. ''The First Hundred Years: 1834-1934 Willamette University from Jason Lee to Carl Doney''.

On September 16, 1891, University Hall, the school's first brick building, caught on fire.<ref name=statesman1990>1840-1990 Keepsake Edition: Willamette University. ''Statesman Journal'', October 26, 1990.</ref> As a result of the fire the top two floors of the building as well as the roof were destroyed.<ref name=WU/> The building was then re-built after the 1891 fire, but unlike the original plans it was constructed with a [[Mansard]] style roof.<ref name=statesman1990/> Additionally, a square tower was also built on top in lieu of the original cupola which included a school bell.<ref name=statesman1990/><ref>[http://photos.salemhistory.net/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/sj&CISOPTR=969&REC=3 Historic Photographs Collection].

Retrieved on August 31, 2007.</ref> From its construction until 1987, Waller Hall was used as an academic hall and hosted classes along with housing the school's chapel and as offices for the faculty.<ref name=cic/>

In 1912, Willamette renamed the building in honor of the Reverend Alvan (Alvin) F. Waller who was instrumental in getting the hall built.<ref name=SOH/> Then on December 17, 1919, another fire swept through Waller Hall while school was on break for Christmas.<ref name=statesman1990/><ref>{{cite news|title=Colleges Resume Work|date=January 8, 1920|work=The Oregonian|pages=6}}</ref> This second fire completely gutted the five-story building, but the exterior walls remained intact.<ref name=WU/> The Mansard roof and square tower were destroyed in the fire.<ref name=statesman1990/> The university rebuilt the hall the following year, and used the original plans that included the round cupola but omitted the Mansard style roof and the square [[tower]] topping the structure.<ref name=SOH/> Architect Fred A. Legge oversaw the rebuilding and re-design of the hall.<ref name=scene>Kuhn, Cheryl. “Living up to Lausanne”, ''Willamette Scene'', Vol. 2, No. 1, Spring 1985, pp. 12-13.</ref> A campaign launched in 1920 by the university was set to raise $100,000 to be used for the reconstruction of Waller, plus completing the new [[Lausanne Hall]] and adding a central heating plant.<ref>{{cite news|title=$100,000 to be Raised|date=April 25, 1920|work=The Oregonian|page=16}}</ref> 

There was some discussion of demolishing the hall in the 1980s after the structure had become dilapidated.<ref name=cic/> One proposal called for building a replica on the same site as the original, but school administrators opted to renovate Waller Hall.<ref name=cic/> From November 1987 to November 1989 the {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building went through a $2.26 million [[renovation]].<ref name=eesi/> This renovation addressed interior issues with the building including [[seismic]] upgrades in the event of a large magnitude earthquake.<ref name=renovation2005>De Carbonel, Dan. Waller Hall renovation covers next 100 years. ''Statesman Journal'', August 16, 2005.</ref> These renovations also turned the attic into an office suite for the school’s president.<ref name=cic/> After renovations in 1988 the building was used for university administration offices.<ref name=cic/> Further renovations were completed in 2005 at a cost of $1.3 million for upgrading the 100-year-old windows to newer energy efficient models, repairing the brick, fixing leaks, installing [[skylight (window)|skylights]], re-painting, and slightly lightening the exterior red-brick coloring.<ref name=renovation2005/>
