A '''boardwalk''', in the conventional sense, is a wooden [[walkway]] for [[pedestrian]]s and sometimes [[vehicles]], often found along [[beach]]es, but they are also common as paths through [[wetland]]s, [[coast]]al [[dune]]s, and other sensitive environments.

Boardwalks along [[intertidal zone]]s are known as [[foreshoreway]]s. A boardwalk along a [[river]] is often known as a [[riverwalk]] and a boardwalk along an oceanfront is often known as an [[oceanway]]. Aside from their obvious pedestrian usage, boardwalks have been used to create commercial districts and enable commerce along waterfronts where conventional streets would have been more expensive because of a beach or other waterfront feature. Although boardwalks can be found around the world, they are especially common along the [[East Coast of the United States]] in [[North America]].

Many of the original boardwalks in the United States have developed to be so successful as commercial districts and tourist attractions that the simple wooden pathways have been replaced by [[esplanade]]s made of concrete, brick or other construction, sometimes with a wooden facade on the surface and sometimes not. Indeed in many parts of the U.S. today the term ''boardwalk'' often carries more the connotation of a waterfront, pedestrian, entertainment district than the original meaning of a wooden path. One of the earliest such boardwalks was designed in [[New Jersey]] and opened June 26, 1870, in [[Atlantic City]].<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jun26.html Today in History: June 26 at the Library of Congress]</ref>

==Examples==
===California===
====[[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]], [[Santa Cruz, California]]====
This boardwalk is the oldest [[amusement park]] in [[California]] and is the home to two [[national historic landmark]]s — the [[Santa Cruz Looff Carousel and Roller Coaster|Looff Carousel]] and the [[Giant Dipper]] [[roller coaster]].  The boardwalk was opened in 1907. The Santa Cruz Boardwalk no longer actually has any wooden boardwalks. Rather, the entire area is covered in concrete.

====[[Venice Beach, California]]====
This 2.5 kilometer boardwalk has a bike path, rollerskaters and skateboard ramps, restaurants, sunglasses, and plenty of tourists. Venice Beach is famous for muscle beach, where body builders work out. [[Governor of California|California governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] worked out on [[Muscle Beach]] and made [[Gold's Gym]] famous in the 1980s.

====[[Newport Beach, California]]====
Newport Beach's boardwalk is a concrete path running 2.9 miles from 36th Street to between E and F Streets on the [[Balboa Peninsula]].  It passes [[McFadden Square]] and [[Newport Pier]], and [[Balboa Pier]].  Speed limit along the path is 8 MPH, to prevent conflicts between bicyclists and pedestrians, as well as [[skateboarders]] and [[rollerbladers]].

===Delaware===
====[[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]]====
This mile-long long boardwalk connects summer tourists with Rehoboth Beach's main attractions during the summer months, including high-end resorts, numerous shops, arcades, eating establishments and family amusement center. The town's main street, Rehoboth Avenue, intersects with the boardwalk.

====[[Bethany Beach, Delaware]]====
Bethany Beach's boardwalk, while not as long as [[Rehoboth Beach]]'s, connects the summer seaside resort's broad, sandy beach to motels, restaurants, and vacation homes.  In 2011 Bethany Beach banned smoking on the beach and boardwalk.

===Louisiana===

===Maryland===
[[File:Ocean City MD Boardwalk August 2009 1.jpg|thumb|right|The boardwalk in [[Ocean City, Maryland]].]]

====[[Ocean City, Maryland]]====
This three-mile (5&nbsp;km) long boardwalk is at the heart of downtown Ocean City, Maryland.  Located at the eastern end of [[U.S. Route 50]], it supports two amusement parks, Ripley's Believe it or Not, as well as arcades, shops, restaurants, hotels, time-shares, and condominiums.

===Massachusetts===
====[[Sandwich, Massachusetts]]====
This boardwalk does not, strictly speaking, lead along the beach. Instead, it begins in a parking lot and leads through the salt marshes and out to the beach. It was destroyed in 1991 by Hurricane Bob and was then rebuilt through donations made by the townspeople. In turn, family names were carved into the planks of the boardwalk, and it is still used to this day. The boardwalk crosses a creek, where at high tide, visitors can jump off the bridge into the water.

===New Hampshire===
====[[Hampton Beach, New Hampshire]]====
This boardwalk is largely a tourist attraction. In fact, it is widely used for common shops where tourists can purchase souvenirs and trinkets to remember their trip.

===New Jersey===
New Jersey is the location of most of the boardwalks in the U.S., with nearly every town and city along the shore having one. The first and longest boardwalk in the world is in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].

====[[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]====
The [[Atlantic City, New Jersey#Boardwalk|Boardwalk]] starts at Absecon Inlet and runs along the beach for four miles (six kilometers) to the city limit.  An additional one and one half miles (two kilometers) of the Boardwalk extend into [[Ventnor City, New Jersey|Ventnor City]].  Casino/hotels front the boardwalk, as well as retail stores, restaurants, and amusements.  Several piers extend the boardwalk over the Atlantic Ocean.  Garden Pier houses the [[Atlantic City Historical Museum]] and the [[Atlantic City Art Center]]. The four story "Pier at Caesars" entertainment complex opened in July 2006. This boardwalk gained fame due to the [[board game]] ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', which was based upon the trading and dealing of [[real estate]] in Atlantic City; in the game, Boardwalk is the most expensive property to purchase and develop, but also yields the greatest rent payoffs to its owner.
In the fall of 2010 HBO launched the drama series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', which is named after and constantly returns to the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

Other boardwalk activities include enjoying the sunrise with a leisurely walk, a brisk jog, a bike tour, a ride on a surrey cart, or a meal at one of the many ocean front cafes.

====[[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]]====
This {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} long promenade is full of game stands, pizzerias, souvenir shops, beach gear stores, arcades and ice cream parlors drawing families, teenagers and adults alike.  The [[Seaside Heights]] boardwalk is bookended by two {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[piers]] that feature amusement rides, carousels, log flumes, roller coasters, Ferris wheels and more.  One of these piers is the world-famous [[Casino Pier]], home to a 1913 circa merry-go-round, the Niagara Falls log flume and the Jet Star roller coaster.  The other is the [[Funtown Amusement Pier]] home to the Tower of Fear, Seaside's tallest [[Ferris wheel]] and a go-kart track.  Across from [[Casino Pier]] is the redeveloped [[Jenkinson's Breakwater Beach]] waterpark (formerly WaterWorks).  Many of the businesses are still family-owned and operated and have been almost as long as the boardwalk has been around.

====[[Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey]]====
About seven miles (11&nbsp;km) from [[Seaside Heights]], the [[Point Pleasant Beach]] boardwalk (frequently known as Jenkinson's Boardwalk) is similar to the boardwalk found in [[Seaside Heights]], but is a bit more subdued.  The promenade extends from the [[Manasquan Inlet]] in the northern end of the borough to the border with [[Bay Head]] in the south.  Right in the middle is the Jenkinson's Amusements/Jenkinson's Boardwalk area brimming with rides, games, carnival food, miniature golf, fun houses, souvenir shops, and Jenkinson's Aquarium.

====[[Wildwood, New Jersey]]====
The 2 mile (3 kilometer) long boardwalk has a total of three amusement piers plus a myriad of other carnival games, souvenir shops, food stands, waterparks, and world-class roller coasters. The Boardwalk started out as a mere 150 feet (45 m). It has actually been moved closer to the ocean twice. Today, the boardwalk stretches from 38 blocks from 16th Ave in [[North Wildwood]] to Cresse Ave in [[Wildwood Crest]].  The Wildwood Boardwalk is said to have more rides than Disneyland. Kiddie rides include a convoy of airplanes, trucks, dune buggies, boats, and trains. Flying elephants, teacups, bouncing giraffes, mini-Ferris wheels, and a traditional carousel round out the mix. The Boardwalk piers boast several waterparks and four major roller coasters.<ref>http://www.moreyspiers.com/</ref> In 2008-2009 a section of the boardwalk was rebuilt using [[Tabebuia|ipe]] tropical hardwood, even though the town pledged to use domestic [[black locust]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Wildwood Opts for Ipe Wood Over Black Locust in Boardwalk Construction |url=http://www.capemaycountyherald.com/article/38282-wildwood-opts-ipe-wood-over-black-locust-boardwalk-construction |quote= |work=[[Cape May County Herald]] |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref>

===Alaska===
[[Eskimo]] villages of the [[Yukon]]-[[Kuskokwim]] Delta, [[Alaska]] — Today, {{convert|10|ft|m|2}} wide heavy-duty boardwalks are common in villages throughout this part of [[Bush Alaska]]. Tuntutuliak was the first village to receive them in the mid 1990s by way of a government funded program to determine whether they would be a worthwhile investment elsewhere. Before the existence of these boardwalks, a much narrower, lower, and less extensive system of boards and boardwalks served delta villages. [http://www.tunt.blogspot.com]
