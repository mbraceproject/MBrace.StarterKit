The '''Auburn Tigers swimming and diving''' program is [[Auburn University]]'s representative in the sport of [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[diving]]. The [[Auburn Tigers|Tigers]] compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]](NCAA) Division 1 and are members of the [[Southeastern Conference]](SEC). The program started in 1932 when the pool was in the basement of the gymnasium. The program had to telegraph their timed results to other schools and compare as the pool was too small for competitions.<ref name=AUS&DHIST/>

The Tiger's first national champion was Scott Spann Sr, who won the 200m [[Individual Medley]] in 1978.<ref name=AUS&DHIST/>  The women's team became a full NCAA sport in 1982.<ref name=AUS&DHIST/> [[David Marsh (swimming coach)|David Marsh]] was hired in 1990 and he would make Auburn into a national powerhouse.<ref name=AUS&DHIST/>   

Under Marsh the program has won a combined thirteen NCAA national championships.

Auburn has regularly been represented in the [[Olympic games]], with a University record sixteen swimmers at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympic Games]] where five Auburn Tigers won a record thirteen medals. At the same Olympics, [[Kirsty Coventry]] won her seventh Olympic medal to replace Auburn alumnus and [[NBC]] swimming commentator [[Rowdy Gaines]] at the top of the Auburn roster of Olympic medallists. Also in the Beijing games [[César Cielo Filho]] became the first Auburn swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal in the 50m Free Style event.<ref name=Olympics08B/>

==History==
Auburn's swimming and diving program got off to a modest start in 1932. Swimming in the basement of the Alumni Gym (which no longer exists on campus) the Tigers swam in a small pool which only had room for three lanes. Swimmers were timed and results were telegraphed to other schools for comparisons. The first real competitions were held in 1936, with ten swimmers competing. The Tigers first swam in the SEC Championships in 1940 and placed 5th. With the outbreak of World War II, Auburn stopped all intercollegiate sports and swimming was not reinstated after the war due to inadequate facilities.<ref name=AUS&DHIST/>

The team was reinstated in 1947, and reentered the SEC Championships by 1948. Auburn's new pool was built in 1970 as the SEC swimming teams started to gain recognition nationally. Auburn finished 3rd in the SEC and 17th in the NCAA meet in 1974, the highest finish in school history at that time. The Tigers climbed up to second in the NCAA's by 1978, in which Auburn captured the first individual NCAA champion in school history when Scott Spann Sr. won the 200 IM and the 100 breaststroke. Women's swimming was added as an SEC and NCAA sport (before 1982 it was an AWIA sport) in 1982, after the women's Auburn team was already competing. The women finished fourth in that year.<ref name=AUS&DHIST/>    

In 1990, Auburn hired [[David Marsh (swimming coach)|David Marsh]] who would take the Tigers to new heights. He led the 1994 men to an SEC title, the first in school history. That same year, the Tiger women won the {{convert|200|yd|sing=on}} medley relay, becoming the first team outside of Stanford, Texas, or Florida to win a NCAA title in a relay at the NCAA meet. The men would go on to win the 1997 National Championship, the first team in Auburn history to win an NCAA title. The women swimmers became the first Auburn women's team to win an NCAA title in 2002. The women would then win the SEC title in 2003 for the first time, with the men also winning an SEC Championship (their seventh consecutive) marking the first time the men's and women's SEC championships were held by the same school.<ref name=AUS&DHIST/>  Later that year, the Auburn teams combined to sweep the NCAA titles, another first for men's and women's teams coached by the same person.<ref name=AUS&DHIST/><ref name="WhiteHouse"/>  Auburn had established itself as a national swimming power.<ref name=AUS&DHIST>{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/aub/sports/c-swim/auto_pdf/2005-06-Media-Guide-Part-4.pdf |format=PDF|title=Auburn Swimming and Divig Media Guide|publisher= Auburn University Athletics Department |accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>  Auburn had another first for a swimming program in 2005. After winning the 2005 national title the Auburn men's team became the first men's swimming and diving team invited to be honored at the [[White House]] by then President [[George W. Bush]]. The women joined the men the next year.<ref name="WhiteHouse"/><ref name="WhiteHouse2">{{cite web |url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/11152.asp |format=PDF|title=Auburn's Championship Squads to visit White House |publisher= Swimming World Magazine |accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>

David Marsh's career as Auburn Head Coach ended in March 2007 after leading the Tigers to the 2007 Men's and Women's national titles in his fourth sweep of the events. Marsh finished with 17 SEC Championships and a record-tying 12 National Championships. The coach he tied is incoming Tigers coach Richard Quick who won 12 combined national titles as the Women's Head Coach for Texas and Stanford.<ref name=Quick>{{cite web |url=http://www.texassports.com/sports/w-swim/spec-rel/010609aaa.html |title=Swimming and Dving Preview: Auburn |publisher= University of Texas Athletics Department |accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref>

In 2008 the Auburn women finished second to [[The University of Arizona|Arizona Wildcats]]<ref name=W08>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&ATCLID=1362521&KEY=&DB_OEM_ID=17300&DB_LANG=&IN_SUBSCRIBER_CONTENTl |title=2008 NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships |publisher= Ohio State University Athletics Department |accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref> while the men finished in fifth place.<ref name=M2008>{{cite web |url=http://ncaaswim.com/men08/Results/MCompleteResults.pdf |format=PDF|title=Men's D1 2008 Results|publisher= NCCA |accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref>

In 2009 the Tigers reclaimed the Men's national title by edging out second place Texas by 39 points. The 2009 title was the eighth for the men and the 13th overall for Auburn. It also marked Richard Quick's 13th title after winning twelve at Stanford and Texas. He moved ahead of former Auburn coach David Marsh for the most titles for a coach in his career and became the first coach to win national titles at three schools.<ref name=AU20092/>   

During the 2008-2009 season [[Brett Hawke]], a former Auburn swimmer himself, took over the day to day running of the men's program after Richard Quick was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After the season Auburn Athletics Director Jay Jacobs announced that Hawke would be promoted to Co-Head Coach and would work with both the Men's and Women's programs while consulting with Quick.<ref name="Hawke"/>

==Facilities==

{{Main|James E. Martin Aquatics Center}}
The Auburn Swimming and Diving program competes in the [[James E. Martin Aquatics Center]]. The center first opened in the 1993 and was designed to be one of the premier [[natatorium]]s in collegiate swimming and diving. The James E. Martin Aquatics Center has hosted multiple competitions including the SEC Championships three times, the NCAA Championships twice, as well the 1995, 2000, and 2005 U.S. Open competitions. In the months leading up to the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympic Games]] swimming teams from [[Israel]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Africa]], and [[Finland]] used the facility to train while the US Olympic [[Water Polo]] also used the facility.<ref name=AubSwimFacilities>{{cite web |url=http://auburntigers.cstv.com/facilities/aub-facilities-swim.html |title= Auburn's James E. Martin Aquatics Center|publisher= Auburn University Athletics Department |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>

The facility cost $10.5 million dollars and was a pet project of its namesake, former Auburn University President James E. Martin. Seating at the center has room for 1,000 spectators and an additional 800 poolside seats for competitors. The competition pool features a state of the art gutter system that absorbs waves instead of reverberating back into the pool, which creates a calmer swimming surface. The bulkheads also provide a flow-through design to prevent waves on turns. The pool is nine feet deep at the shallowest and {{convert|16.5|ft|m}} below the diving apparatus. The entire pool is {{convert|77|yd}} long (232&nbsp;ft) and 25 yards (75&nbsp;ft) wide. The bulkheads are movable and allow variable lengths for competition and practice as well as simultaneous diving. The facility also features the original Auburn competition pool, renovated as a warm-up and practice pool.<ref name="AubSwimFacilities"/>

In the summer of 2007, Auburn University completed work on a new $1 million dollar outdoor training pool, part of a large scale effort by the Auburn Athletics Department to improve the school's facilities.<ref name=AubOutdoorPool>{{cite web |url=http://www.al.com/birminghamnews/stories/index.ssf?/base/sports/1183192044301010.xml&coll=2|title= Trustees quickly open checkbook for 92.5 million arena|publisher= Birmingham News |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>  Head Coach Richard Quick believes the pool will push Auburn's swimming facilities to elite status<ref name=Quick>{{cite web |url= http://www.al.com/press-register/stories/index.ssf?/base/sports/1182417717220020.xml&coll=3&thispage=3

==Men's swimming and diving==
On top of their seven national titles, the Auburn men have won several SEC championships. Since their first SEC Championship in 1994, Auburn has won 14 out of the last 15 SEC titles, including 13 straight since 1996.<ref name="SEC08">{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/goldmine/2008/02/sec_champs_auburn_men_women_sw.html |title= SEC CHAMPS: Auburn Men, Women swim to titles |publisher= Birmingham News |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>  Only Tennessee has broken Auburn's SEC championship streak. Between January 11, 2001 and January 11, 2007 Auburn did not lose a single dual meet (meets in between 2 or 3 teams only). The only team to beat Auburn during that time period was arch swimming rival Texas, when they snapped the Tigers 44 consecutive dual meet winning streak by a score of 130-113.<ref name="Texas">{{cite web |url=http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/c-swim/recaps/011107aaa.html |title= Auburn Men's Swimming And Diving Falls To No. 1 Texas, Snapping 44-Dual Meet Win Streak |publisher= Auburn University Athletics |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>

The 2006 Men's Swimming and Diving senior class, consisting of Kurt Cady, George Bovell, Eric Shanteau, and Doug Van Wie finished as the only senior class in AU History for any sport to go undefeated their entire college career. They never lost a Dual, SEC, or NCAA meet.<ref name="WhiteHouse">{{cite web |url=http://auburn.scout.com/2/515418.html |title= White House to Honor Auburn Champions |publisher= Scout.com |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref><ref name="WhiteHouse2"/>  

The 2007 Men's SEC Championship team dominated the conference competition, winning by 114.5 points over the second place Florida. The men's team won 11 individual conference titles, including sweeping all diving and relay events.
[[Image:AUBCELEBRATE.jpg|thumb|right|The 2007 Auburn teams celebrate their national titles at Toomers Corner in Auburn]]
Like the conference, Auburn's men dominated the 2007 NCAA championship meet. The Tigers scored 566 points in the meet, easily outdistancing second place Stanford who scored 397 points, a difference of 169. On the very first swim of the meet, the {{convert|200|yd|sing=on}} freestyle relay, the Tigers set a new NCAA record in the prelims which they then broke in the championship final (1:14.71). Auburn would go on to set NCAA records in four more events, the 50 Free ([[César Cielo Filho|César Cielo]], 18.69), 100 Free (César Cielo, 41.17), the 400 Free relay (2:46.56), and the 200 Medley Relay (1:23.37). César Cielo became the first Auburn swimmer since Rowdy Gaines to win the 100 Free national title, and the first Auburn swimmer to win the 100 and 50 free in the same NCAA meet. Auburn diver Steven Segerlin repeated his 2006 Platform diving championship and won the 3M Springboard title to go with his third place in the 1M Springboard. Auburn was awarded for its dominance by sweeping the post meet awards, David Marsh was named NCAA Division I Men's Swimming Coach of the Year, head diving coach Jeff Shafer was named NCAA Division I Men's Diving Coach of the Year, César Cielo was named NCAA Division I Men's Swimmer of the Year and Steven Segerlin was named NCAA Division I Men's Diver of the Year.<ref name=5thstraight>{{cite web |url=http://www.al.com/auburn/birminghamnews/index.ssf?/base/sports/1174207691170660.xml&coll=2 |title=Auburn swimmers roll to fifth straight NCAA title |publisher= The Birmingham News |accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref><ref name=AUMen>{{cite web |url=http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/c-swim/recaps/031707aag.html

In the 2009 SEC Championship meet, Auburn's men won first place for the 13th consecutive time, tying a conference record. Auburn was led by [[Matt Targett]], who won seven individual SEC championships, winning every event he entered. He was named SEC Male Swimmer of the year for his efforts.<ref name=AU2009SEC>{{cite web |url=http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/c-swim/recaps/022209aaa.html |title=Auburn Men Claim 13th Consecutive SEC Title |publisher= Auburn Tigers Official Website |accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref>  In the 2009 National Championships held in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], [[Texas]] Auburn trailed rival Texas for the first two days of the competition.

In 2005, Auburn lost to Georgia by two points at the NCAA championships and in the SEC Championships in 2006. The second place finisher at the SEC championships went on to win the national championship while the SEC champion won national runner-up for those two years. The 2007 SEC Championships saw the close competition between the Dogs and Tigers come to an end, as Auburn beat Georgia by 228 points while Georgia finished 5th in the NCAA championships to Auburn's first place finish.
