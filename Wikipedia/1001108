==Campus==
[[Image:VU-HeritageHall-1905.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Heritage Hall, Valparaiso University, 1905]]

===Location===
Valparaiso is located 54 miles southeast of downtown [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and is the southeasternmost suburb of the Chicago metropolitan area.  It is also {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore]].  The {{convert|320|acre|ha|1|sing=on}} campus as well as its main entrance are located off [[U.S. Highway 30]] on the south side of the city and is the site of over sixty buildings and a number of academic resources.

===Old Campus===
[[Image:VU-OldCollegeBuilding-1918.jpg|thumb|200px|Old College Building, Valparaiso University, circa 1918]]
The ''Old Campus'' of Valparaiso University is both adjacent to and a part of the historic downtown district of the city.  Old Campus is the site of the [[Valparaiso University School of Law|School of Law]], which is made up of Wesemann Hall and [[Heritage Hall (Valparaiso University)|Heritage Hall]].  Heritage was the oldest remaining building on the campus, and was put on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.  In 2009, the school started a restoration project, only to tear the building down and then rebuild it. The school's fraternities, the Martin Luther King Cultural Center, and the [[Kade-Duesenberg German House and Cultural Center]] are all also located in old campus. Old Campus is also the site of Valpo's [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] [[weather radar]]. Located north of Old Campus is the College of Nursing, whose students use SIMMAN, a robotic patient simulator used to train students in real life treatment to better serve their education.

===New Campus===
Beginning in the 1950s, the school expanded eastward to occupy what is now known as ''New Campus''. Today it is the primary section of the university, home to thousands of students in nine dormitories and most of the academic buildings. At the center of campus is the [[Chapel of the Resurrection]], a {{convert|98|ft|m|0|sing=on}} high building which is the home of Valparaiso University's many worship services and convocations. Built on the highest elevation of land on the university's campus, it has been a [[Northwest Indiana]] landmark since 1959.
The Neils Science Center was erected in 1974 and includes an astronomical observatory, greenhouse, and a now decommissioned sub-critical nuclear reactor which helped the facility receive an Atomic Energy Commission citation as a model undergraduate physics laboratory.
The [[Christopher Center]] Library (built 2004) houses over 500,000 books and numerous video and audio resources. It is a popular place for students to gather and study.
The Valparaiso University Center for the Arts (VUCA) offers multiple performance facilities, which are most notably used by students to produce full scale theatrical performances every year.  The performances and exhibits in the Center for the Arts are always open to the public, and the Center houses the nationally renowned [[Brauer Museum of Art]].
Kallay-Christopher Hall is home to the Department of Geography and Meteorology. Kallay-Christopher has an observation deck and large weather lab facilities. Adjoining Kallay-Christopher Hall is Schnabel Hall, which is home to communications students and [[WVUR-FM]], the university's student-run radio station.
The College of Engineering has both a {{convert|16|in|mm|0|sing=on}} computerized [[reflecting telescope]] to aid in [[NASA]] research and  VisBox-X2, a [[virtual reality]] system used to immerse students in a visualized [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] image. An addition to Gellersen Hall, the College of Engineering building, was completed in the summer of 2011.

===Improvement===
[[File:ValparaisoUniversity Chapel.JPG|thumb|300 px|right]]Building projects at Valparaiso University are funded entirely by donation. The university also receives no support for operation from the state or federal government.

The most notable construction project on campus is the construction of the {{convert|202000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, $74 million new student Union, named in honor of University President Alan F. Harre, who retired in June 2008. It opened in January 2009. The new union is more than 3 times the size of the previous union, and has consolidated all dining services on campus. It has room for all student organizations on campus, as well as a new bookstore, lounge areas, student mailboxes for every student on campus, entertainment areas, a large ballroom (capable of seating 500 for a dinner or 1000 for an auditorium setting), a moon bounce, a career center, and an outdoor terrace overlooking the Chapel.
The design architect was [[Sasaki Associates]], Inc. and the architect of record was Design Organization.

Plans have also been made to expand upon the south end of the Gellersen Hall, where the College of Engineering is located. Construction began in March 2010, and is expected to be completed by August 2011. The $13 million project will cover approximately {{convert|13500|sqft|m2}} and include additional laboratory and learning spaces for Valparaiso's undergraduate engineering students.

==Academics==
[[Image:fireworksVU.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Fireworks by the Chapel of the Resurrection during Homecoming Weekend, September 2007]]

===Undergraduate===
Valparaiso University is organized into five undergraduate colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, Engineering, Nursing, and Christ College.

The Christ College was chartered by President [[O.P. Kretzmann]] in 1967 as the Honors College of Valparaiso University.  Centered in Mueller Hall, it is the successor to the Directed Studies Program, which was established to better serve the influx of gifted students to the institution.  Roughly 80 students, or ten percent of the class, are admitted each year.  Along with concurrent enrollment in a fundamental college, the discourse provides immersion in the fields of history, literature, art, music, philosophy, religion and social science.  A student steering committee composed of upperclassmen guides the development of the program and a multitude of annual events.  The Student Scholarship Symposium features diverse, student selected research projects delivered in a critical and interactive environment.  Students have the option to complete their study with either a major or minor in [[humanities]] to complement that received in their main field of study.

===Graduate School===
Valparaiso University offers a variety of masters programs in Business, Chinese Studies, Education, English Studies & Communication, Information Technology, International Commerce, Policy, Liberal Studies, Nursing, Psychology/Counseling, International Economics and Finance, and Sports Administration.

Valparaiso also has a [[Valparaiso University School of Law|School of Law]] which had an enrollment of 575 students in the Fall of 2010.<ref>[http://www.valpo.edu/law/about/facts.php Valparaiso University School of Law Facts & Figures]</ref>

===Reputation===
''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' named Valparaiso University as #3 in the Universities-Master's category for the [[Midwest]] in its annual rankings of "America's Best Colleges."<ref>{{cite web|title=America's Best Colleges 2007|publisher=U.S. News & World Report|accessdate=2006-09-12|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1univmas_mw_brief.php}}</ref> It also ranked Valparaiso among the "Best College Values" based on a ratio of price to quality, and placed the College of Engineering in the nation's top 25 undergraduate-only engineering schools.<ref>{{cite web | title=Magazine again cites Valpo for excellence, value | publisher=Valparaiso University | accessdate=2006-05-01 | url=http://wwwstage.valpo.edu/engineering/coe/news/081905.php}}</ref> Over ninety-five percent of graduates secure employment or further education (twenty-three percent) within six months. More than ninety percent of students receive financial aid totaling over fifty-two million dollars annually. [[Charity Navigator]] also gave the institution four out of four stars based on its organizational efficiency and capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.summary/orgid/4030.htm|title= Valparaiso University|accessdate= 2007-06-02|publisher= [[Charity Navigator]]}}</ref> 

Valparaiso University has made improvements to become more environmentally sustainable, and was graded a "C+" on the College Sustainability Report Card in 2011.This grade is up from a "D+" the school received only two years before. The report includes high marks in Investment Priorities, Green Building & Climate Change/Energy.<ref name="The College Sustainability Report Card">{{cite web|title=The College Sustainability Report Card|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org//|accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref>

===Faculty===
Valparaiso University faculty work with governments, communities, colleagues, and students.  Ninety percent of the faculty members hold a [[doctorate]] or the highest degree in their field.  Valparaiso is a teaching school where each professor lectures and every class is led by a professor, and there are very few [[teaching assistants]] at Valpo. As a result, in nearly every class professors are on a first name basis with their students.  The student-to-faculty ratio is 12 to 1, and there is an average of 20 students per class.

===Culture===
Valparaiso is a growing school that works to uphold the benefits of an intimate education. Most first-year undergraduate students take a year of [[Core curriculum|Core]], an interdisciplinary course rooted in liberal arts and focused on the understanding the purpose and fulfillment of human life.  About a tenth of incoming freshman alternatively participate in the freshman program of Christ College, Valparaiso University's honor college.  Students are also subject to an [[honor code|honor system]] originally implemented by the students themselves in 1943 which remains in effect today.  The school also puts a heavy focus on diversity.  Each January, the school holds a weekend of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] events as its major annual event and invite provocative and sometimes controversial key-note speakers.

===Study Abroad===
Valparaiso offers study-abroad programs in fourteen nations including sites in [[Cambridge|Cambridge, England]] ([[Anglia Ruskin University]]); [[Osaka|Osaka, Japan]]; [[Reutlingen|Reutlingen, Germany]]; [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla, Mexico]]; [[Namibia]]; Paris, France; and [[Hangzhou|Hangzhou, China]] ([[Zhejiang University]]).
Two of the programs (Cambridge and Reutlingen) are exclusively Valparaiso University programs; the other programs ([[Cergy]], [[La Rochelle]], [[Rottenburg am Neckar]], [[Tübingen]], Puebla, two programs in Paris, Hangzhou, Japan, Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, College Year in [[Athens]], Namibia, and [[Granada, Spain]]) are offered in conjunction with host institution programs. Students studying abroad generally stay for one semester, but study in [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] requires the full year.

===Distance Learning===
The University offers online degree opportunities that include a [http://online.valpo.edu/programs/master-of-chinese-studies/ Master of Arts in Chinese Studies] and a [http://online.valpo.edu/programs/doctorate-in-nursing-practice-dnp/ Post-MSN Doctorate in Nursing Practice]. The accelerated degree programs are Web-based and allow versatile learning.

===Students===
Valparaiso University students are from geographically diverse backgrounds.  Of the 4,000 students, only one-third are from the school's home state of [[Indiana]].  The remaining two-thirds come from almost every other [[U.S. state|state]] of the [[United States]] and over 40 foreign countries.  Over two-thirds graduate in the top quarter of their [[high school]] class and nearly ninety percent return to Valparaiso after their freshman year.  Annually, more than 26 million dollars are awarded by the university to over eighty percent of the student body, which is administered based on factors such as community involvement, interests, recommendations, and personality as well as grade point average, class ranking, and standardized test scores.

Sixty-five percent of Valparaiso University students live on the school's city campus, as University regulations require almost all students who do not have senior status to live in dorms.  Twenty-eight percent of students are Lutheran, but twenty-three percent are [[Catholic]] and eighty-seven percent participate in faith-related activities.  Valpo supports over 100 student administered organizations, clubs, and activities.  Fifty percent of students participate in [[intramural]] athletics, and over 1,000 students give over 45,000 hours of [[community service]] to the region annually.

====Greek life====
More than thirty percent of Valpo students are members of one of the school's eight national [[fraternities]] or seven national [[sororities]].  The entire [[Greek Life]] community is coordinated by the fraternities' ''Interfraternity Council'' and sororities in the ''Panhellenic Council''.  Valparaiso also hosts chapters of all major honors fraternities. Many of the fraternities were local until the 1950s when they were accepted as chapters into national and international fraternities. However, the sororities were local and had no national affiliation until 1998.  [[Theta Chi]] was dismissed from campus in 2010.

==Athletics==
{{main|Valparaiso Crusaders}}
Valpo's colors are [[brown]] and [[gold (color)|gold]] and the school's mascot is the [[Crusade]]r.  Most athletic events are held in the [[Athletics-Recreation Center]] (ARC), which is the primary sporting facility on campus.  Valparaiso's eighteen teams and nearly 600 student athletes participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I (I-FCS for [[College football|football]]) in the [[Horizon League]], except for football, in which they compete in the [[Pioneer Football League]] (the Horizon League does not sponsor football) and play at [[Brown Field (Valparaiso University)|Brown Field]].  The school is known for its well rounded athletes as 98% successfully graduate, which ties Valparaiso with the [[University of Notre Dame]] for the third highest graduation rate in the country.[http://www.nwitimes.com/articles/2006/05/18/news/top_news/98267903b20d5b56862571720006f55b.txt]  Valpo is also known for its men's basketball head coach [[Homer Drew]] and his son [[Bryce Drew]], who led the team to its Sweet Sixteen appearance in the 1998 NCAA basketball tournament by making "[[The Shot (Valparaiso University)|The Shot]]", a three-point shot as time expired to beat favored [[Ole Miss]] by one point.  Bryce Drew was named head coach in the spring of 2011.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/basketball/ncaa/05/17/bryce.homer.drew.ap/index.html?xid=si_ncaab Sports Illustrated - Bryce Drew replacing father Homer at Valparaiso (2011)]</ref>
Valparaiso is also the home of the National Lutheran Basketball Tournament.  Recently the Crusader men's soccer team has been successful, winning the Horizon League regular season in 2011.  Head coach Mike Avery was named Horizon League Coach of the Year, Stefan Antonijevic was named the league's Defensive Player of the Year, and Kyle Zobeck was honored as Horizon League Goalkeeper of the Year.  Sophomore Charles Barden led the team in 2011 with four goals.

What is now Valparaiso University was founded by the Methodist Church in 1859 as '''Valparaiso Male and Female College''', one of the first co-educational four-year institutions in the [[United States]]. Citizens of Valparaiso were so supportive of the placement of the College that they raised $11,000 in early 1859 to encourage the Methodist Church to locate there.

Students paid tuition of $8 per term (three terms per year), plus nearby room and board around $2 per week.  Instruction at the college actually began with young children, and most of the students were in the elementary grade levels.  Courses at the collegiate level included math, literature, history, the sciences, and philosophy.  Courses stressing the Christian faith included "moral philosophy" and "moral science."

[[Image:ValparaisoMaleFemaleCollege.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Valparaiso Male and Female College, circa 1870]]

The school was forced to close in 1871, due to the fallout of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  Not only did most of the men (both students and administrative members) enroll in an army, but Indiana had passed a bill in 1867 that provided for state support for public education, and the Methodists' very broad Indiana-wide efforts toward higher education meant that none of the schools were self-sustaining.  This combination proved too much to overcome for the Male and Female College.<ref>Valpo Magazine.  150th Anniversary Edition.  Pp. 13-41.  Valparaiso, IN: 2008.</ref>

===Intermediate growth===
The school was reopened by [[Henry Baker Brown]] two years later as the '''Northern Indiana Normal School and Business Institute'''. The school was renamed '''Valparaiso College''' in 1900 and gained its current university status when rechartered in 1906.  For the next two decades, Valpo gained a national reputation as an economical institution of higher learning, earning it the positive nickname ''The Poor Man's Harvard''.  At the height of enrollment, it was the second largest school in the nation, behind only [[Harvard University]].<!-- please add the URL for this reference <ref>{{cite web|title=Valparaiso University|format=HTML|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|url=|accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref>--> However, the aftermath of another conflict, [[World War I]], took its toll, and the school was forced into bankruptcy.

===Lutheran revival===
In 1923, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] assembled a bid to purchase the university.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Klan Buys College Close to Princeton |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=422729 |quote=[[Alma White College|Alma College]] is the second institution in the north avowedly run by the Ku Klux Klan to further its aims and principles.

The association was a group of [[clergy]] and church [[laity]] that saw promise in the school and wished to create an academic institution not controlled by any church denomination.  Valparaiso is still operated by the Lutheran University Association, and remains an independent [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] institution which enjoys close relations with the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]].

===Student activism===
As a [[liberal arts]] institution, Valparaiso University has a detailed history of [[student activism]].

;Kinsey Hall fire
While many colleges either amended or canceled the remainder of the 1969-1970 school year following the [[Kent State shootings]] due to unrest, the Valparaiso administration ignored student calls for a series of seminars and forums about violence at other campuses.  A large group of students then organized a protest march from the campus Victory Bell to the [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter County]] courthouse.  Continued protests led to discussions between the administration and student leaders.  When these talks failed, a group of still-unidentified students set fire to the empty Kinsey Hall administrative building in the early morning.  The aftermath of the fire left Kinsey Hall destroyed.

;Venture of Faith
The existence of Valparaiso University's current College of Engineering is the result of student activisim.  The university's engineering program had been reduced to a two-year associate's degree in response to reduced enrollment during economic depression which dominated the 1930s.  When students began inquiring in 1948 regarding the possibility of restoring a four-year degree program, the current university president, O.P. Kretzmann, cited a lack of space and lack of resources to build a new facility.  Students responded with an offer to build the new facility if he would guarantee faculty positions, to which the President agreed.<ref>http://www.valpo.edu/news/news.php?releaseId=232</ref>  The students constructed the facility themselves using their engineering education and an intense fundraising campaign, and by 1951 the new College of Engineering was again granting four-year bachelor degrees.  The building still exists today, home to the Art department.  This story received national attention and was turned into a feature-length film entitled Venture of Faith.<ref>http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/576478/Venture-of-Faith/</ref>

;Burning of the shanty
During the 1988-1989 school year, a mock [[shanty town]] was erected on campus to show solidarity with victims of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].  Mike Weber and Phil Churilla, two columnists for VU's student newspaper ''The Torch'', wrote a column critical of the protest due to student use of portable CD players, wool blankets and packaged food in the shanties.  A few days later the shanty town burned down and a culprit was never found.

;Valparaiso University Police Department
For campus security, Valparaiso University employs a [[university police|police department]] with academy trained and certified officers that sometimes assist other local law enforcement as a result of reciprocal agreements.
Valpo has long been a [[dry campus]],<ref>[http://www.valpo.edu/registrar/05-06studentguide.pdf Student Guide to University Life<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but enforcement was raised dramatically in recent years,<ref>[http://www.valpo.edu/vupd/crimestats.php Valparaiso University Police Department<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and in the spring of 2006, the VUPD began considering placing officers on the campus escort vans in an attempt to curb underage drinking.  Days later a city police officer entered the [http://www.valpo.edu/student/sigpi Sigma Pi] fraternity house with his gun drawn, believing he had witnessed drug use through a window.<ref>[http://nwitimes.com/articles/2006/04/25/news/porter_county/8b4f4eb2be8875518625715b0006e85b.txt VU fraternity house incident outrages students / nwi.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Though university officers only responded to the scene later, these incidents strained student-police relations further, prompting mass resignations of student drivers from the escort service and a protest of over 500 students.<ref>http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/newssentinel/news/local/14443307.htm</ref>  The protests centered on the VUPD's increased focus on alcohol consumption and new placement of police officers with student escort services.
