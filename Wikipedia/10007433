The '''[[Kentucky High School Athletic Association]] boys' and girls' state basketball championships''' are  [[Tournament#Single-elimination|single elimination]] tournaments held each March featuring 16 high schools. Colloquially known as the '''Sweet Sixteen''' (the KHSAA holds a [[trademark]] on the phrase), the tournament takes place over 4 days at Lexington's [[Rupp Arena]] for the boys until 2014 and Bowling Green's [[E. A. Diddle Arena]] on the campus of [[Western Kentucky University]] for the girls until 2011. The state tournaments begin with District tournaments (usually with four, but sometimes with three or five teams) at sites across the state, district winners and runners-up advance to sixteen regional tournaments (usually eight teams each) with the Regional Champions advancing to the Sweet Sixteen. Seeding for the Sweet Sixteen is determined by a blind draw, broadcast on statewide television.

Since its 1918 inception the Sweet Sixteen has built a legacy that includes dynasty teams and dramatic [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] stories. The tournament is particularly noteworthy in that it is only one of three state tournaments (Hawaii and Delaware are the others) without a class system dividing small schools and larger schools into separate championships. The possibility of a small rural Kentucky school defeating a large consolidated school or schools from [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] or [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] for the state championship are a large part of the statewide appeal for the tournament. Such ''[[Hoosiers]]''-like stories are not uncommon for the tournament such as in 1995, 1996, and 2010 when Breckinridge County, [[Paintsville High School|Paintsville]] and Shelby Valley High School defeated much larger schools to win the boys' state championship. Also in 1994 M.C. Napier High School (located near [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]]), (it would be consolidated into Perry County Central High School), claimed the girls title. They would play one more season in 1995 before consolidation. In the boys 2010 Championship game, Shelby Valley with an enrollment of under 600 students defeated Louisville Ballard the twelfth largest high school in Kentucky. 

Another emotional story came in the 1981 boys' tournament, when [[Simon Kenton High School]] of [[Independence, Kentucky|Independence]], whose students were forced into involuntary exile after a series of natural gas explosions in October 1980 destroyed much of the school, won the state title. However, the greatest finish in Boys Sweet Sixteen history came in the 1982 State Championship game between Laurel County and [[North Hardin High School|North Hardin]] led by high school All-American Robbie Valentine. With the game tied and one second remaining, Laurel County's Paul Andrews hit a desperation 50-foot shot to win the game 53-51.

The unique nature of the tournament and NBA-style pre-game and post-game ceremonies and celebrations at the finals draw fans throughout the state to both tournaments. Crowds for the boys' tournament usually total around 120,000 fans during the week and the finals typically draw 15-20,000 spectators.
