'''Jacksonville University''' ('''JU''') is a [[private university|private]] [[university]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]], on the banks of the [[St. Johns River]]. The school was founded in 1934 as a two year college and was known as '''Jacksonville Junior College''' until 1958, when it shifted its focus to four-year university degrees and adopted its present name. It is a member of the [[Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida]] and is accredited by [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS) and the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB). Its sports teams are known as the [[Jacksonville Dolphins]].


==History==
The school was founded in 1934 by William J. Porter. Originally known as William J. Porter University, it began as a private two-year college. Since a permanent site had not yet been acquired, classes were held on the third floor of the [[First Baptist Church (Jacksonville, Florida)|First Baptist Church]] Educational Building in downtown [[Jacksonville]].<ref name=timeline>[http://www.ju.edu/anniversary/timeline.aspx "Timeline"]. www.ju.edu. Retrieved October 20, 2010].</ref> Sixty students were enrolled in Porter University's first year of operation.<ref>[http://www.ju.edu/anniversary/default.aspx "75th Anniversary"]. www.ju.edu. Retrieved October 20, 2010.</ref>

The school changed its name to Jacksonville Junior College in 1935. It relocated three times over the next fifteen years, including a period in the [[Florida Theatre]] building, but the influx of [[GI bill]] students following the end of [[World War II]] made it necessary for the school to find a permanent location. In 1947 the administration purchased land in Jacksonville's [[Arlington, Jacksonville, Florida|Arlington]] neighborhood on which to establish the current campus. The first building was completed in 1950 and classes officially began.<ref name=FTU>{{cite news |title= The hidden treasure awaiting excavation|first= Joe|last= Humphrey|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= September 29, 2000|url= http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/092900/met_4207131.html|accessdate= October 20, 2010}}</ref> The same year the school received full accreditation as a two-year college from the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS).<ref name=timeline/>

In 1958 Jacksonville Junior College merged with the Jacksonville College of Music, and the name was changed to Jacksonville University. In 1959 the first four-year class graduated, and in 1962 JU received full accreditation as a four-year school from SACS. The 1960s saw the university grow substantially as enrollment increased, dormitories were built, two new colleges were established and the [[Swisher Gymnasium]] was constructed. In 1970 the [[Jacksonville University Dolphins]] [[men's basketball]] team, under star [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Artis Gilmore]], went to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Division I Championship]]. However, the opening of the public [[University of North Florida]] in 1973 eroded JU's enrollment, while the removal of public funding hurt the school financially. In the 1990s Jacksonville University reconfigured itself as primarily a [[liberal arts college]] and embarked on a substantial fundraising campaign, which provided for the construction of new buildings and a revision of the campus master plan.<ref name=timeline/><ref name=FTU/>

The JU Flight Team competes in [[National Intercollegiate Flying Association]] Regional and National Safety and Flight Evaluation Conference (SAFECON) against other universities. The best team performance came in 2007. The program is the third largest in the nation behind Spartan School in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] and the [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach]]. The Jacksonville Univ. Flight Team placed 10th in the nation at the National Intercollegiate Flying Association’s. “Among the many trophies that Jacksonville won, Jacksonville earned the prestigious Collegiate Aviation Progress Award given to the school that has made the greatest improvements in the nation,” said Juan Merkt, director of JU’s aeronautics program. "Jacksonville Univ. moved from 20th place overall last year to 10th this year, so this is indeed an impressive accomplishment." Jacksonville Univ. also placed 10th overall in Flight Events and eighth in Ground Events.

Terry Alexander, the winningest coach in Jacksonville's baseball history with 631 wins, enters his 31st year at Jacksonville and his 20th year as the program’s head coach. He led his team to nine NCAA Regional appearances, won six conference championships (1995, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009) and has completed five 40-win seasons. He has also coached 10 All-America honorees, 50 all-conference selections and helped 44 players get drafted by Major League Baseball organizations.

Jacksonville has a [[college basketball]] program, which years ago produced [[professional basketball]] stars such as [[Artis Gilmore]], Otis Smith, Pembrook Burroughs III and Rex Morgan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In 1970, Jacksonville University became the second smallest school (behind St. Bonaventure) ever to make it to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]], and then to the National Championship game.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} They were led by [[head coach]] [[Joe Williams (basketball coach)|Joe Williams]]. After defeating the [[St. Bonaventure University|St. Bonaventure team]] in the tournament semi-finals, they lost to the [[UCLA Bruins]] in the National Championship game. In that tournament, UCLA was the only team to hold Jacksonville under 100 points.  The following season, Jacksonville became the first college basketball team to average 100+ points per game - at a time when there was no three-point shot and no shot clock in college basketball. In 2009 Jacksonville won the regular season [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] title in men's basketball, but fell to [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers men's basketball|East Tennessee State]] in the conference tournament title game. The Dolphins were invited to the [[National Invitation Tournament]], the school's first post-season tournament since 1986, but they lost in the first round to the [[University of Florida Gators]].

JU Football won their first PFL title in 2008.

JU is also noted for its rowing program after taking the overall FIRA Cup (States) in 2007. Recently JU has expanded its rowing program with the addition of the Negaard Rowing Center. The JU rowing program has happily celebrated over 50 years of success around the world and has competed from the shores of the Nile River to the icy water's of England's Henley Royal Regatta. 

In 2008, the school announced that they will add a men's and women's [[lacrosse]] program during the 2009-2010 academic year.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Greek and student life==


The school's Greek system, consisting by some estimates of 69% of the school{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, includes [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Mu Phi Epsilon]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], and [[Sigma Nu]] fraternities and the [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Alpha Epsilon Phi]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], and [[Gamma Phi Beta]] sororities.

53 percent of all students live on campus in one of three different residential halls and eight different apartment style housing. Most residence halls provide academic and social events as well as host programs that acclimate incoming students to the college experience. 

While Greeks do offer some social events, many residence halls host their own events, though alcohol policies are strictly enforced.

The student center of the University (the Davis Student Commons Building) includes a fitness center overlooking the St. Johns River, a sports-themed dining facility named Nellie's (after the school mascot), a game room for all campus community members, while serving as a focal point for campus life. The facility opened in October 2006. 

Student life at Jacksonville University includes opportunities in a diverse range of activities and organizations. Besides fraternities and sororities, there are multicultural groups, arts groups, political and social action groups, service and professional groups, religious groups, sports and recreation groups, academic and professional groups, and special interest groups.

There are also a [http://www.ju.edu/departments/studentlife/campusactivities/ministries.aspx variety] of campus ministries on campus. In 2011, yet another campus ministry, [http://campustocity.org/ Campus to City Wesley Foundation], started meeting at JU.

Campus media organizations include the student newspaper (The Navigator), the campus radio station (JU108), the literary and arts magazine (The Aquarian), the student run broadcasting station (Dolphin Channel), and the yearbook (The Riparian). The Jacksonville University Student Alliance serves the needs of the student body as a whole by electing representatives from the university's student organizations, residential communities and colleges. In addition, the Florida Leader magazine ranked JU as the third-best positive student life experience out of the 28 private colleges and universities in the state, citing the small campus size, peer and faculty relationships, and the close-knit campus community that JU has to offer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
